Absolutely — here's a fully remade **PowerPoint deck outline** tailored for your Phase 4 deliverable, organized around the required flow:

---

## 🎯 **Slide 1: Title Slide**
- **Title:** *"Unsupervised Interpretability Model for NBA Trade Suggestions"*
- **Subtitle:** *"Analyzing Player Fit, Trade Value, and Salary Impact Using Machine Learning"*
- **Your Name**
- **Background Image:** NBA court or silhouette of trade negotiation

---

## 💼 **Slide 2: Business & Data Understanding**
- **Title:** *"The Business Problem"*
- **Content:**
  - NBA front offices need to assess trade fairness across player performance, team fit, and salary.
  - Existing trade models are often subjective and lack transparency.
  - Objective: Use unsupervised modeling to evaluate player roles and trade scenarios with interpretable scoring.
- **Data Sources Used:**
  - Player stats (Per 36, Per 100, Advanced)
  - Play-by-play tendencies (e.g., Bad Pass, Lost Ball)
  - Salary and contract details
  - Team ratings (ORtg, DRtg, Net Rating)
- **Why it’s well-suited:**
  - High-dimensional, numeric data
  - Covers full player & team dynamics for trades

---

## 🧹 **Slide 3: Data Preparation**
- **Title:** *"From Raw Stats to Trade Insights"*
- **Content:**
  - Combined 7+ sources via `SQL` joins into one master player table and others.
  - Selected key features: OBPM, DBPM, WS/48, USG%, contract size, On-Off impact.
  - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler` for clustering.
  - Imputed missing values with `SimpleImputer`.
  - Extracted 25+ player metrics for modeling.
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas`, `sqlite3`, `sklearn.preprocessing`, `shap`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

---

## 🧠 **Slide 4: Modeling Approach**
- **Title:** *"Clustering and Interpretability for Trade Analysis"*
- **Content:**
  - **Clustering:** KMeans used to identify player roles from 25 numeric stats.
  - **Cluster Optimization:** Evaluated k=2 to 10 using:
    - Elbow, Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin
  - **Final k=4 clusters** interpreted as:
    1. Defensive Bigs
    2. Primary Playmakers
    3. 3&D Wings
    4. Offensive Spark Plugs
  - **Interpretability:** Random Forest + SHAP used to explain:
    - Player Fit Index
    - Trade Value Index
    - **Salary Cap Impact:** Relative to team payroll and luxury tax


---

## 🧾 **Slide 5: Metrics & Evaluation**
- **Title:** *"How the Model Evaluates Trade Scenarios"*
- **Content:**
  - **Player Fit Score:** DBPM, OBPM, USG%, TOV%, TRB%
  - **Trade Value Score:** BPM + WS relative to salary
  - **Salary Cap Impact:** Relative to team payroll and luxury tax
  - **SHAP** visualizations show which features influence each score
- **Validation:**
  - `train_test_split` used to validate interpretability models
  - Regression models explained 70–80% of variance for Fit and Value Scores

---

## 🧑‍💼 **Slide 6: Stakeholders & Use Cases**
- **Title:** *"Who Benefits From This Model?"*
- **Content:**
  - **NBA GMs & Coaches** → Objective trade comparison
  - **Analysts & Scouts** → Cluster-based player evaluation
  - **Sports Media** → Explain trades with visuals & fairness scores
  - **Fans/Fantasy GMs** → Understand trade logic and player roles

---

## ⚠️ **Slide 7: Common Trade Challenges**
- **Title:** *"Problems in Traditional Trade Analysis"*
- **Content:**
  | Problem | Solution |
  |--------|----------|
  | Trade subjectivity | Clustering & SHAP objectify analysis |
  | Fit is unpredictable | Fit Score shows synergy |
  | Salary risks are hidden | Salary Cap Score highlights overpayment risk |

---

## ✅ **Slide 8: Final Takeaways**
- **Title:** *"Key Takeaways"*
- **3 Icons + Captions:**
  1. 📊 *"Objective Trade Scoring with Data Science"*
  2. 🔍 *"Role-Based Player Insights via Clustering"*
  3. 💰 *"Salary Cap Impact Integrated into Decision-Making"*

---

## ❓ **Slide 9: Q&A**
- **Title:** *"Trade Talk: Any Questions?"*
- **Content:**
  - Invite audience to propose their own NBA trade to analyze live
- **Background:** Image of an NBA press conference or trade headline
